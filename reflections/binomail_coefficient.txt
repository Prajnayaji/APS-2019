binomial coefficient:
there are three methods to calculate binomial co-efficnet of an array

2-d array:
1) it uses dynamic programming
2) we can use it whenever we need to compute a binomial coefficient of large number and we need all the coefficient value from 1 to k
3) as it involves pre-computation time complexity is n*k

recurrsion:
1) it is used when you have a small number so that recurrsion will not use much space
2) time complexity is (2^k)n

memory occupied is same in both the cases, but to calculate many values we need to do recalculation in case of recurrsion whereas in dynamic programming it is pre calculated.

1-d array:
1) it is used when we need to calculate the binomial co-efficnet of only one line.
2) time complexity is k.
